README

I have included a makefile to make two C programs.

granttoe_hw2 is the program I made and contains the functionality to
shrink or expand a bmp file, it is functional on it's own.

granttoe_hw2_runner is a program that runs granttoe_hw2 to the 
specification given (creating "small.bmp" and "big.bmp") by
simply running granttoe_hw2 twice.

To run this, type:

make
./granttoe_hw2_runner <your test .bmp file>
